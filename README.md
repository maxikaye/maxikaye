- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maxikaye
- I have spent my career up until now as a designer, audio engineer, illustrator and developer.
- My current focus is to become a more focused and skilled developer.
- Collaboration comes natural to me after years playing in bands and creating art and music with others.
- I look forward to collaborating on code with you.
